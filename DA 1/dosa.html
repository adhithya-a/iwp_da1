            <h2>Why is Ghee Roast Dosa my favourite dish?</h2>
            <p> I first tried Ghee Roast Dosa as a kid in Adyar Ananda Bhavan (A2B) restaurant. They made the dosa in a cone shape, and placed a banana leaf below it, and gave us sambar and chutney as side dishes. I was impressed by their presentation of the dish, and when I tried, it tasted even better.</p>
            <p> Ever since then, this dosa has been my favourite dish, and I always order it whenever I go to South Indian restaurants.</p>

<h4><strong>Ingredients</strong>: 1 ½ cups of idli rice, ½ cup urad dal, 1 tablespoon of chana dal, 1/3 cup of thick poha, 20 methi seeds, ½ tsp of salt, water and ghee.</h4>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl soak the idli rice and washed poha for about 4-5 hours.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, take urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds. Rinse and soak for the same amount of time.</li>
    <li>After grinding mix both batters together add salt and leave for 10-12 hours for fermentation.</li>
    <li>Stir the batter once before you start making your dosas.</li>
    <li>Heat ghee in a tawa on medium flame and pour the batter.</li>
    <li>Once the top side of the dosa looks done, pour ghee on top and sides of the dosa. This will make the edges crisp and golden.</li>
    <li>Fold the cooked dosa and serve with coconut chutney.</li>
